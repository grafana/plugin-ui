# ShareTimeRangeButton

ShareTimeRangeButton is a component that provides URL sharing functionality with time range preservation for use cases where
time range info is stored in the URL as a query parameter such as "from" and "to".

It consists of a button group with a primary share button and a dropdown menu offering different URL copying options as
well as options for specifying which query parameters should be used.

When copying URLs:

- If no time range is present, it defaults to the last 30 minutes
- Relative time ranges (e.g., 'now-6h') are converted to absolute timestamps
- Absolute time ranges are preserved as-is

# Usage

```jsx
<ShareTimeRangeButton />
```

```jsx
<ShareTimeRangeButton collapsed={true} />
```

<ArgTypes of={ShareTimeRangeButton} />
